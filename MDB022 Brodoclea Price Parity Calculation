#Brodoclea Woodland Farm price parity estimate

#How much value would the current business need to generate as an ecosystem service,
#in order to achieve price parity with factory farmed meat? 

price.kg.brodoclea.pork<-6.20
print(price.kg.brodoclea.pork)
hang.weight.kg.brodoclea<-70
farmgate.price.pig<-(price.kg.brodoclea.pork*hang.weight.kg.brodoclea)

brodoclea.acres<-430
brodoclea.sounder<-200

#So farm is generating £434 per pig. They have 200 pigs over 430 acres. 
#Brodoclea is generating £86000 in income from pork product. 

gdp.acres.brodoclea<-gdp.farm/brodoclea.acres
print(gdp.acres.brodoclea)

#£201 of pork product is produced per acre per year at Brodoclea.

#Next is calculation of factory farmed pork, for comparisons sake.
#Data is taken from https://ahdb.org.uk/pork/gb-deadweight-pig-prices-uk-spec, week end 12th Oct 2024
#NB that this is cheaper, and pigs are harvested fatter. Mangoliza is a smaller breed

price.kg.FF.pork<-2.04
hang.weight.kg.FF.pork<-93.54 
FF.price.pig<-(price.kg.FF.pork*hang.weight.kg.FF.pork)
print(FF.price.pig)

#FF pigs retail for £190. Brodoclea's pigs are £434. 

price.delta<-(farmgate.price.pig-FF.price.pig)
print(price.delta)

#A FF pig is £243 cheaper than a Brodoclea pig. 
#But NB that FFs externalize the cost of carbon (importing soy feed, land use change overseas, inter alios)
#And Brodoclea is currently not charging the Future Forest Company for the carbon it is sequestering, despite increasing regeneration
#To calculate price parity: 

carbon.payment.requirement.parity<-(price.delta*brodoclea.sounder)/brodoclea.acres
print(carbon.payment.requirement.parity)

#Brodoclea would only have to charge £113 per acre for ecosystem services for its pork products to achieve price parity with factory farmed meat.
